# The Cartographers Project Proposal: 

## Overall Goal
Because of the recent changes in AI technology, we think it would be a beneficial idea to incorporate new up-and-coming technologies such as ChatGPT into existing mapping software in order to improve road trips and general navigation. Our idea is to have navigation software similar to Google Maps while allowing the user to input text prompts that respond back with information about their desired destination.

Say for example you are going on a trip to Miami Beach, FL, and want to create multiple stops along the way; ChatGPT is great for providing feedback on multiple different landmarks and destinations that are available along a certain route because of the information fed to the language model. 

## Key Features
Our idea is an application that allows users to instantly generate a full vacation itinerary given any user-made prompt.

### Generated with Artificial Intelligence
This project will be relying on the help of Chat GPT in order to create a vacation given a users prompt as well as tune it towards the user’s preferences.

### General Routing
At a minimum, we want to offer the user the ability to automatically generate a route from one location to another. This includes route creation, vehicle rentals, plane ticketing, and public transport information.

### Lodging
With almost all of these planned vacations, our users must find a place to stay for the duration of the trip. We will use plenty of popular lodging sites like Tripadvisor, Booking.com, and Airbnb in order to give users the best options.
Restaurant and Eateries
During this vacation, users can explore nearby restaurants and other places to eat. We want these options to be integrated into our app. Users can even specify parameters like food preferences and price.

### Activities
Of course, vacations are planned around activities. Users will be free to use our app to location preference-related activities near their location. These may include anything from clubs and sports games to water parks and arcades.
Landmarks / Pit Stops
It’s important to take breaks while on a long, multiple-hour long road trip so our app plans on using the Google Maps API to locate rest stops, gas stations, and other similar stops to give the user the break they need from driving.
